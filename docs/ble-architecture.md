# Columba BLE Architecture Documentation

This document describes the complete Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) architecture for Reticulum networking on Android, covering all layers from Python protocol handling through native Android BLE operations.

## Architecture Overview

The BLE implementation follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Component | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Python | `BLEInterface` | Reticulum interface, packet fragmentation/reassembly, peer lifecycle |
| Python | `BLEPeerInterface` | Per-peer Reticulum routing interface |
| Python | `AndroidBLEDriver` | Bridge to Kotlin, callback routing |
| Kotlin | `KotlinBLEBridge` | Entry point for Python, connection tracking, deduplication |
| Kotlin | `BleScanner` | Device discovery with adaptive intervals |
| Kotlin | `BleAdvertiser` | Peripheral advertising with identity |
| Kotlin | `BleGattClient` | Central mode GATT operations |
| Kotlin | `BleGattServer` | Peripheral mode GATT service |
| Kotlin | `BleOperationQueue` | Serialized GATT operations (Android limitation) |

---

## BLE Operation Queue

Android's BLE stack does **not** queue operations internally. If you call multiple GATT operations in succession (e.g., `readCharacteristic()` then `writeDescriptor()`), the second operation fails silently. `BleOperationQueue` ensures serial execution with proper completion tracking.

### Queue Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Callers["Multiple Callers"]
        C1[GATT Client]
        C2[Handshake]
        C3[Data Send]
    end

    subgraph Queue["BleOperationQueue"]
        Q[operationQueue<br/>Channel UNLIMITED]
        P[Queue Processor<br/>Single coroutine]
        Comp[operationCompletion<br/>Channel RENDEZVOUS]
    end

    subgraph BLE["Android BLE"]
        BLE1[BluetoothGatt]
    end

    C1 --> Q
    C2 --> Q
    C3 --> Q
    Q --> P
    P --> BLE1
    BLE1 -->|Callback| Comp
    Comp -->|Unblock| P
```

### Operation Flow

Operations follow one of two paths:

1. **Synchronous operations** (e.g., `SetCharacteristicNotification`): Return `Success` or `Failure` immediately, queue processor moves to next operation.

2. **Asynchronous operations** (e.g., `WriteCharacteristic`, `DiscoverServices`): Return `Pending`, queue processor blocks on `operationCompletion.receive()` until the GATT callback fires and calls `completeOperation()`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Queue as BleOperationQueue
    participant BLE as Android BLE
    participant Callback as GATT Callback

    Caller->>Queue: enqueue(WriteCharacteristic)
    Queue->>Queue: Create timeout job (5s)
    Queue->>BLE: writeCharacteristic()
    BLE-->>Queue: returns true (queued)
    Queue->>Queue: Return Pending
    Queue->>Queue: Block on operationCompletion.receive()

    alt Success path
        BLE-->>Callback: onCharacteristicWrite(SUCCESS)
        Callback->>Queue: completeOperation(Success)
        Queue->>Queue: Cancel timeout
        Queue->>Queue: operationCompletion.trySend(Unit)
        Queue-->>Caller: Resume with Success
    else Timeout path
        Note over Queue: 5 seconds pass
        Queue->>Queue: Resume with TimeoutException
        Queue->>Queue: operationCompletion.trySend(Unit)
        Note over Queue: CRITICAL: Must signal completion<br/>or queue deadlocks forever
    end

    Queue->>Queue: Process next operation
```

### Completion Signaling (Critical)

The queue processor blocks on `operationCompletion.receive()` for async operations. **Every code path that ends an async operation must signal completion**:

| Code Path | Signal Location |
|-----------|-----------------|
| GATT callback success | `completeOperation()` line 272 |
| GATT callback failure | `completeOperation()` line 272 |
| Timeout | Timeout handler line 209 |
| Exception during execution | Exception handler line 231 |

**Failure to signal causes global queue deadlock**: All subsequent operations for ALL connections will timeout without executing, because the single queue processor is stuck waiting.

**Key code reference**: `BleOperationQueue.kt` — queue processor (lines 158-180), enqueue (lines 189-244), completeOperation (lines 252-273)

## GATT Service Structure

The Reticulum BLE service follows Protocol v2.2 specification:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ReticulumService {
        UUID: 37145b00-442d-4a94-917f-8f42c5da28e3
        Type: PRIMARY
    }

    class RXCharacteristic {
        UUID: 37145b00-442d-4a94-917f-8f42c5da28e5
        Properties: WRITE, WRITE_NO_RESPONSE
        Permissions: WRITE
        Purpose: Centrals write data here
    }

    class TXCharacteristic {
        UUID: 37145b00-442d-4a94-917f-8f42c5da28e4
        Properties: READ, NOTIFY, INDICATE
        Permissions: READ
        Purpose: Peripherals notify data here
    }

    class IdentityCharacteristic {
        UUID: 37145b00-442d-4a94-917f-8f42c5da28e6
        Properties: READ
        Permissions: READ
        Purpose: 16-byte transport identity
    }

    class CCCDDescriptor {
        UUID: 00002902-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
        Purpose: Enable/disable notifications
    }

    ReticulumService --> RXCharacteristic
    ReticulumService --> TXCharacteristic
    ReticulumService --> IdentityCharacteristic
    TXCharacteristic --> CCCDDescriptor
```

### Characteristic Details

| Characteristic | UUID Suffix | Direction | Purpose |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| RX | `...28e5` | Central → Peripheral | Data and identity handshake writes |
| TX | `...28e4` | Peripheral → Central | Notifications for outbound data |
| Identity | `...28e6` | Read-only | Provides 16-byte transport identity hash |

## Connection Flows

### Central Mode Connection Sequence

        Note over Client,Peer: Identity Handshake (Protocol v2.2)
        Client->>Peer: Step 1: Read Identity Characteristic

    Bridge->>Python: onConnected(address, mtu, role, identity)
    Python->>Python: _spawn_peer_interface<br/>(address, identity, mtu, role)
```

### Peripheral Mode Connection Sequence

When a remote central connects to us:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Central as Remote Central
    box rgb(30, 73, 102) Kotlin Native Layer
    participant Server as BleGattServer
    participant Bridge as KotlinBLEBridge
    end
    box rgb(55, 118, 71) Python Layer
    participant Python as AndroidBLEDriver
    end

    Central->>Server: connectGatt()
    Server->>Server: onConnectionStateChange(CONNECTED)
    Server->>Bridge: onCentralConnected(address, MIN_MTU)
    Note over Bridge: Tracks as pending connection<br/>(awaiting identity from central)

    Central->>Server: discoverServices()
    Central->>Server: Read Identity Characteristic
    Server-->>Central: Our 16-byte identity

    Central->>Server: requestMtu()
    Server->>Bridge: onMtuChanged(address, mtu)

    Central->>Server: Enable CCCD notifications

    rect rgb(147, 112, 219)
        Note over Central,Python: Identity Handshake (Protocol v2.2)
        Central->>Server: Write 16 bytes to RX
        Server->>Bridge: onDataReceived(address, data)
        Bridge->>Python: on_data_received(address, data)
        Python->>Python: _handle_identity_handshake()<br/>Detect: len=16, no existing identity
        Note over Python: Store identity mapping:<br/>address_to_identity[addr] = bytes<br/>identity_to_address[hash] = addr<br/>
        Note over Python: Create fragmenter/reassembler<br/>key = identity.hex() (32 chars)<br/>fragmenters[key] = BLEFragmenter(mtu)<br/>reassemblers[key] = BLEReassembler()
    end

    Python->>Python: _spawn_peer_interface<br/>(address, identity, mtu, role)
```

### Defensive Recovery for Missed onConnectionStateChange

Android's `onConnectionStateChange` callback is unreliable and sometimes doesn't fire, even when a BLE connection is established. When this happens, the connection would be "orphaned" - data arrives but can't be sent back because the address isn't registered.

The fix: When `handleCharacteristicWriteRequest` receives data from an address not in `connectedCentrals`, it retroactively registers the connection:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Central as Remote Central
    participant Server as BleGattServer
    participant Bridge as KotlinBLEBridge
    participant Python as AndroidBLEDriver

    Central->>Server: connectGatt()
    Note over Server: ⚠️ onConnectionStateChange NOT called<br/>(Android BLE bug)
    Note over Server: connectedCentrals is empty

    Central->>Server: Write data to RX characteristic
    Server->>Server: handleCharacteristicWriteRequest
    Server->>Server: Check: address in connectedCentrals?

    rect rgb(255, 230, 230)
        Note over Server: DEFENSIVE RECOVERY
        Server->>Server: Address NOT found!<br/>Log warning
        Server->>Server: Add to connectedCentrals
        Server->>Server: Set MTU = MIN_MTU
        Server->>Bridge: onCentralConnected(address, mtu)
        Bridge->>Bridge: Add to connectedPeers
    end

    Server->>Bridge: onDataReceived(address, data)
    Note over Server,Python: Connection now properly tracked
```

**Key log message**: `"DEFENSIVE RECOVERY: Data received from {address} but onConnectionStateChange was never called!"`

**Key code reference**: `BleGattServer.handleCharacteristicWriteRequest()` lines 721-748

## Identity Protocol (v2.2)

### Purpose

Android randomizes MAC addresses for privacy. The identity protocol provides stable peer identification across MAC rotations.

### Handshake Sequence (Central → Peripheral)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Central
    participant P as Peripheral

    Note over C: Connect as GATT client
    C->>P: Read Identity Characteristic
    P-->>C: Peripheral's 16-byte identity
    Note over C: Store bidirectional mapping:<br/>address_to_identity[addr] = bytes<br/>identity_to_address[hash] = addr

    C->>P: Write 16 bytes to RX Characteristic
    Note over P: Detect identity handshake:<br/>exactly 16 bytes, no existing identity
    Note over P: Store bidirectional mapping:<br/>address_to_identity[addr] = bytes<br/>identity_to_address[hash] = addr

    Note over C,P: Both sides now have<br/>bidirectional identity ↔ address mapping
```

### Identity Tracking Data Structures

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Python["Python (BLEInterface)"]
        P_A2I["address_to_identity<br/>MAC → 16 bytes"]
        P_I2A["identity_to_address<br/>16-char hex → MAC"]
        P_SI["spawned_interfaces<br/>16-char hex → BLEPeerInterface"]
        P_Cache["_identity_cache<br/>MAC → (16 bytes, timestamp)<br/>TTL: 60s"]
    end

    subgraph Kotlin["Kotlin (KotlinBLEBridge)"]
        K_A2I["addressToIdentity<br/>MAC → 16 bytes<br/>(central mode only)"]
        K_I2A["identityToAddress<br/>16-char hex → MAC<br/>(central mode only)"]
        K_Peers["connectedPeers<br/>MAC → PeerConnection"]
        K_Pending["pendingConnections<br/>MAC → PendingConnection"]
    end

    K_A2I -.->|"central mode: populates"| P_A2I
    K_I2A -.->|"central mode: populates"| P_I2A
```

> **Note on 16-char hex keys:** Maps like `identity_to_address` and `spawned_interfaces` use truncated 64-bit keys (16 hex chars) for shorter log output. Birthday collision risk is ~2³² (~4 billion) identities — astronomically safe for BLE mesh networks with <100 peers. Fragmenter/reassembler keys use full 32-char hex for maximum precision in packet reassembly.

**Identity detection by connection role:**
| Role | Who Detects | How |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Central (we connect to them) | Kotlin (GattClient) | Reads Identity Characteristic |
| Peripheral (they connect to us) | Python (BLEInterface) | Detects 16-byte write to RX |

### MAC Rotation Handling

**Problem:** Android devices rotate their BLE MAC address every ~15 minutes for privacy. This breaks naive address-based peer tracking — the same physical device appears as a "new" peer after rotation.

**Solution:** Use the 16-byte Reticulum identity (exchanged during handshake) as the stable peer identifier. When a new connection arrives with a known identity but different MAC, migrate all address-based mappings to the new MAC while preserving the peer interface and fragmenter state.

**Important:** Identity detection differs by connection role:
- **Central mode** (we connect to peer): Kotlin reads Identity Characteristic → `handleIdentityReceived`
- **Peripheral mode** (peer connects to us): Python detects 16-byte handshake → `_handle_identity_handshake`

**Central mode flow** (we connect to peer with new MAC):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[We connect to MAC_NEW<br/>Read Identity Characteristic] --> B[Kotlin: handleIdentityReceived]
    B --> C{Kotlin: onDuplicateIdentityDetected?<br/>Calls Python _check_duplicate_identity<br/>Returns: bool}
    C -->|"Returns True<br/>(identity already at different MAC)"| D[Reject: disconnect MAC_NEW<br/>Log: Duplicate identity rejected]
    C -->|"Returns False or no callback"| E[Allow: continue processing]

    E --> F{Kotlin: existingAddress =<br/>identityToAddress‹hash›}

    F -->|"null<br/>(new identity)"| G[shouldUpdate = true]
    F -->|"MAC_OLD exists"| H{Is MAC_OLD actually connected?<br/>gattClient.isConnected‹MAC_OLD›}

    H -->|"No, or MAC_NEW has central"| G
    H -->|"Yes, and MAC_NEW lacks central"| I[shouldUpdate = false<br/>Keep MAC_OLD as primary]

    G --> J[Update identityToAddress‹hash› = MAC_NEW]
    J --> K{existingAddress ≠ null<br/>AND existingAddress ≠ MAC_NEW?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Kotlin: onAddressChanged‹MAC_OLD, MAC_NEW›]
    K -->|No| M[No address change notification]

    I --> N[Keep identityToAddress‹hash› = MAC_OLD]

    L --> O[Python: _address_changed_callback<br/>Migrate peer mappings]

    N --> P[Always: addressToIdentity‹MAC_NEW› = hash]
    M --> P
    O --> P
```

**Key code reference**: `KotlinBLEBridge.handleIdentityReceived()` lines 1997-2150

**Peripheral mode flow** (peer with new MAC connects to us):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[MAC_NEW connects to us<br/>Writes 16-byte identity to RX] --> B{Python: _handle_identity_handshake<br/>Entry check: len=16 AND<br/>no address_to_identity‹MAC_NEW›}
    B -->|Check fails| Z[Return False: not a handshake<br/>Pass to normal data handler]
    B -->|Check passes| C{Python: _check_duplicate_identity<br/>identity_to_address‹hash› = MAC_OLD?}

    C -->|"No MAC_OLD or<br/>MAC_OLD = MAC_NEW"| E[Allow: continue processing]
    C -->|"MAC_OLD exists and<br/>MAC_OLD ≠ MAC_NEW"| C2{Is old connection alive?}

    C2 -->|"pending_detach‹hash› exists<br/>(old connection gone)"| C3[Cleanup stale MAC_OLD<br/>Allow reconnection]
    C2 -->|"MAC_OLD not in connected_peers<br/>AND not in peers"| C3
    C2 -->|"MAC_OLD still connected"| D[Reject: driver.disconnect‹MAC_NEW›<br/>Log: duplicate identity rejected<br/>Return True: handshake consumed]

    C3 --> E

    E --> F[Store mappings unconditionally:<br/>address_to_identity‹MAC_NEW› = identity<br/>identity_to_address‹hash› = MAC_NEW]
    F --> G{spawned_interfaces‹hash› exists?}
    G -->|No| H[Create new BLEPeerInterface<br/>via _spawn_peer_interface]
    G -->|Yes| I{existing.peer_address ≠ MAC_NEW?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Update existing interface:<br/>peer_address = MAC_NEW<br/>address_to_interface‹MAC_NEW› = interface]
    I -->|No| K[No update needed<br/>Same address already set]
```

**Key code reference**: `BLEInterface._handle_identity_handshake()` lines 1108-1200

**On disconnect (MAC_OLD disconnects while MAC_NEW still connected):**
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[MAC_OLD disconnects] --> B{Identity still<br/>connected at MAC_NEW?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Cache: staleAddressToIdentity<br/>MAC_OLD → identity]
    B -->|No| D[Clean up all mappings<br/>for this identity]
```

**Key behaviors:**
- **Early rejection (both modes)**: `_check_duplicate_identity` rejects if identity already connected at different MAC **AND the old connection is still alive** — works in both central mode (via Kotlin callback) and peripheral mode (in `_handle_identity_handshake`). Crucially, if the old connection has `pending_detach` scheduled or is no longer in `connected_peers`/`peers`, the reconnection is **allowed** (stale entry cleanup).
- **Central preference**: Kotlin prefers mappings with live central connections (more reliable for sending)
- **Stale cache**: On disconnect, `staleAddressToIdentity` caches old address → identity, allowing `send()` to resolve old addresses during transition
- **Fragmenter/Reassembler unaffected**: Keyed by identity (32-char hex), not address — they continue working across MAC rotations without migration

### Identity Timeout Handling

**Problem:** Non-Reticulum BLE devices (AirTags, fitness trackers, BLE scanners) may connect to our GATT server but never send the 16-byte identity handshake. Without cleanup, these connections would persist indefinitely, consuming resources and cluttering connection tracking.

**Solution:** Track peripheral-mode connections in `_pending_identity_connections` with their connect timestamp. A periodic cleanup timer (30s interval) disconnects any connection that hasn't received an identity within the timeout period (30s).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Connection["New Peripheral Connection"]
        A[Central connects to us<br/>role = peripheral] --> B{Identity received<br/>with connection?}
        B -->|Yes| C[Process normally<br/>Skip timeout tracking]
        B -->|No| D[Add to _pending_identity_connections<br/>address → timestamp]
    end

    subgraph Cleanup["Periodic Cleanup Timer (30s interval)"]
        E[Timer fires] --> F[For each pending connection]
        F --> G{elapsed > 30s?}
        G -->|Yes| H[Log timeout warning<br/>Disconnect address<br/>Remove from pending]
        G -->|No| I[Keep waiting]
    end

    subgraph Success["Identity Handshake Received"]
        J[16-byte write to RX<br/>_handle_identity_handshake] --> K[Remove from<br/>_pending_identity_connections]
        K --> L[Continue normal<br/>connection setup]
    end

    D -.->|"If handshake arrives"| J
    D -.->|"If timeout expires"| G
```

**Key code references:**
- Tracking: `BLEInterface._on_device_connected_callback()` — adds to `_pending_identity_connections` for peripheral role
- Cleanup: `BLEInterface._cleanup_pending_identity_connections()` — called by periodic timer
- Removal: `BLEInterface._handle_identity_handshake()` — removes on successful handshake

**Configuration:**
| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `_pending_identity_timeout` | 30s | Max wait time for identity handshake |
| Cleanup timer interval | 30s | How often to check for timeouts |

**Common timeout causes:**
- Non-Reticulum devices connecting (AirTags, scanners)
- Network congestion delaying handshake
- Central disconnecting before sending identity
- BLE stack issues on connecting device

## Deduplication State Machine

**Problem**: When two devices discover each other simultaneously, both may initiate connections — Device A connects to B (A becomes central), while B connects to A (B becomes central). This creates a "dual connection" where both devices have central AND peripheral connections to each other. Without deduplication, this wastes resources (2x connections, 2x data paths) and can cause duplicate packet delivery.

**Solution**: When a dual connection is detected (`peer.isCentral && peer.isPeripheral`), compare identity hashes to deterministically choose which connection to keep. Both devices perform the same comparison, so they independently arrive at the same decision — one keeps central, the other keeps peripheral, and the redundant connections are closed.

**Location**: `KotlinBLEBridge.handlePeerConnected()` — Kotlin layer only. Python is not involved in deduplication decisions.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(( )) -->|Initial state| NONE[NONE]

    NONE -->|"peer.isCentral && peer.isPeripheral<br/>(KotlinBLEBridge.kt:1702)"| Decision{Compare identity hashes}

    Decision -->|"our identity > peer"| CLOSING_CENTRAL[CLOSING_CENTRAL<br/>Keep peripheral]
    Decision -->|"our identity < peer"| CLOSING_PERIPHERAL[CLOSING_PERIPHERAL<br/>Keep central]

    CLOSING_CENTRAL -->|"Central disconnected"| NONE2[NONE]
    CLOSING_PERIPHERAL -->|"Peripheral disconnected"| NONE2
```

### DeduplicationState Enum

```kotlin
enum class DeduplicationState {
    NONE,              // Normal - use actual isCentral/isPeripheral
    CLOSING_CENTRAL,   // Keeping peripheral, central disconnect pending
    CLOSING_PERIPHERAL // Keeping central, peripheral disconnect pending
}
```

### Deduplication Flow (Kotlin Layer)

All deduplication logic runs in `KotlinBLEBridge.kt`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Bridge as KotlinBLEBridge
    participant Client as BleGattClient
    participant Server as BleGattServer

    Note over Bridge: handlePeerConnected() detects:<br/>peer.isCentral && peer.isPeripheral (line 1702)

    alt peerIdentity == null OR localIdentityBytes == null
        Note over Bridge: Identity not yet available<br/>Deduplication deferred (line 1724-1726)
    else Both identities available
        Bridge->>Bridge: Compare identity hashes<br/>localIdentityHex vs peerIdentity (line 1711)
        alt localIdentityHex < peerIdentity (we keep central)
            Bridge->>Bridge: Set state = CLOSING_PERIPHERAL
            Bridge->>Bridge: Set dedupeAction = CLOSE_PERIPHERAL
        else localIdentityHex > peerIdentity (we keep peripheral)
            Bridge->>Bridge: Set state = CLOSING_CENTRAL
            Bridge->>Bridge: Set dedupeAction = CLOSE_CENTRAL
        end

        Bridge->>Bridge: Add peerIdentity to<br/>recentlyDeduplicatedIdentities (cooldown)
    end

    Note over Bridge: Execute disconnect outside mutex (line 1764)

    alt dedupeAction == CLOSE_CENTRAL
        Bridge->>Client: disconnect(address)
    else dedupeAction == CLOSE_PERIPHERAL
        Bridge->>Server: disconnectCentral(address)
    end

    Note over Bridge: On disconnect callback:<br/>state returns to NONE (lines 1800-1810)
```

**Key code reference**: `KotlinBLEBridge.handlePeerConnected()` lines 1701-1775

**Note**: Deduplication does NOT call `onAddressChanged`. Python is notified via the normal `onConnected` callback, and Python handles its own deduplication logic if needed. The `onAddressChanged` callback is only used for MAC rotation address migration in `handleIdentityReceived`.

### Reconnection Cooldown (`recentlyDeduplicatedIdentities`)

**Problem**: Without a cooldown, deduplication causes a reconnection storm:
1. We connect as central to Device B
2. Device B connects to us → dual connection detected
3. Deduplication closes our central, keeps their peripheral
4. Scanner rediscovers Device B → immediately reconnects as central
5. Dual connection again → repeat forever

**Solution**: After deduplication, add the peer's identity to `recentlyDeduplicatedIdentities` with a 60-second cooldown. The scanner checks this list before connecting — if the device name prefix matches a recently deduplicated identity, skip it.

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Deduplication closes central | Add identity to cooldown (line 1722) |
| Scanner discovers device | Check if name matches cooldown list (lines 993-1015) |
| 60 seconds pass | Entry expires, reconnection allowed |
| Identity fully disconnects | Remove from cooldown immediately (line 1830) |

**Important**: The cooldown is only removed when the identity is *fully* disconnected (no connections remain at any address). While the peripheral connection is still active, the cooldown persists to prevent reconnection storms.

## Data Flow

### Sending Data (Python → BLE)

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Python["Python Layer"]
        A[BLEPeerInterface.process_outgoing] --> B[Get fragmenter by identity_key]
        B --> C[fragmenter.fragment_packet]
        C --> D["Fragments with header:<br/>type(1) + seq(2) + total(2)"]
        D --> E["driver.send(peer_address, fragment)"]
    end

    subgraph Kotlin["Kotlin Layer"]
        E --> F[KotlinBLEBridge.sendAsync]
        F --> G{Resolve address via identity<br/>if peer not found}
        G --> H{"useCentral?<br/>(isCentral && state != CLOSING_CENTRAL)"}
        H -->|Yes| J[GattClient.sendData]
        H -->|No| I{"usePeripheral?<br/>(isPeripheral && state != CLOSING_PERIPHERAL)"}
        I -->|Yes| K[GattServer.notifyCentrals]
        I -->|No| L{deduplicationState != NONE?}
        L -->|Yes| M[Log warning, PACKET DROPPED]
        L -->|No| N[Silent no-op, PACKET DROPPED<br/>Invalid state]
        J --> O[Write to RX characteristic]
        K --> P[Notify via TX characteristic]
    end

    O --> Q[Remote peripheral receives]
    P --> R[Remote central receives]
```

**Key implementation details** (KotlinBLEBridge.kt lines 1255-1325):
- Address resolution handles MAC rotation by looking up the current address via identity mappings
- During deduplication, only the *closing* path is blocked—the other path continues to work
- For example, during `CLOSING_CENTRAL`, the peripheral path is still available for sending
- **Packet loss during deduplication**: If both paths are blocked (rare edge case where peer has dual connection but both are closing), packets are dropped with a warning log. This window is brief—once disconnect completes, the remaining path resumes. Reticulum's transport layer handles retransmission if needed.

### Receiving Data (BLE → Python)

```mermaid

        A[Notification/Write received]
    end

    subgraph Kotlin["Kotlin Layer"]
        A --> B{Is central or peripheral?}

        F -->|Yes| H[Update peer.lastActivity]
        H --> I[Forward ALL data to Python]
    end

    subgraph Python["Python Layer"]
        I --> J[BLEInterface._data_received_callback]
        J --> K{_handle_identity_handshake?}
        K -->|Yes, 16 bytes, no identity| L[Store identity mapping<br/>Return early]

        R -->|Yes| S[peer_interface.process_incoming]
        R -->|No| T[Wait for more fragments]
    end
```

**Key implementation details** (KotlinBLEBridge.kt lines 1964-2013, BLEInterface.py lines 1108-1970):
- Kotlin validates fragment size against `MAX_BLE_PACKET_SIZE` before processing
- `lastActivity` timestamp is updated for keepalive tracking (handles MAC rotation via identity lookup)
- Python filters 1-byte `0x00` keepalive packets—these are Android BLE supervision timeout prevention
- Identity handshake detection: exactly 16 bytes when no identity is stored
- If identity not found, Python tries the `_identity_cache` before requesting driver resync

## Keepalive Mechanism

Android BLE connections timeout after 20-30 seconds of inactivity. Both layers implement keepalives:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as BleGattClient<br/>(Central)
    participant Timer as Keepalive Timer<br/>(15s interval)
    participant Peer as Remote Peripheral

    Note over Client: Connection established
    Client->>Timer: Start keepalive job
    Client->>Peer: Write 0x00 immediately
    Note over Client: Prevents early timeout

    loop Every 15 seconds
        Timer->>Client: Send keepalive
        Client->>Peer: Write 0x00 to RX
        alt Success
            Peer-->>Client: Write confirmed
            Client->>Timer: Reset failure counter
        else Failure
            Client->>Timer: Increment failures
            alt failures >= 3
                Timer->>Client: Connection dead
                Client->>Client: disconnect()
            end
        end
    end
```

### Keepalive Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Interval | 15 seconds | `BleConstants.CONNECTION_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL_MS` |
| Max failures | 3 | `BleConstants.MAX_CONNECTION_FAILURES` |
| Packet | `0x00` (1 byte) | Minimal overhead |

**Key implementation details** (BleGattClient.kt lines 1081-1181, BleGattServer.kt lines 1000-1060):
- Both sides send an **immediate first keepalive** on connection, then continue at 15s intervals
- **Central (BleGattClient)**: Tracks `consecutiveKeepaliveFailures`, disconnects after 3 failures
- **Peripheral (BleGattServer)**: Fire-and-forget notifications—no failure tracking or disconnect logic
- This asymmetry is intentional: the central manages connection lifecycle, the peripheral just keeps it alive

### Keepalive Job Lifecycle

Keepalive jobs are coroutines that run independently from connection state. Proper cleanup is critical to prevent orphaned jobs.

**Problem**: If `disconnectCentral()` removes an address from `connectedCentrals` without stopping the keepalive job, the job continues running forever. Each keepalive attempt fails with "No connected centrals" (since the address is gone), creating log spam and wasting resources.

**Solution**:

1. **Explicit cleanup in `disconnectCentral()`**: Call `stopPeripheralKeepalive(address)` **before** removing from `connectedCentrals`. This is critical because `cancelConnection()` doesn't reliably trigger `onConnectionStateChange`, so the normal disconnect handler may never run. See `BleGattServer.kt` line 477.

2. **Defensive loop exit**: The keepalive loop checks for "No connected centrals" errors and breaks out if the target is no longer tracked. This is a safety net for cases where cleanup is missed. See `BleGattServer.kt` lines 1045-1048.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[disconnectCentral called] --> A2[gattServer.cancelConnection]
    A2 --> B[stopPeripheralKeepalive]
    B --> C[Cancel keepalive Job]
    C --> D[Remove from peripheralKeepaliveJobs]
    D --> E[Remove from connectedCentrals]
    E --> E2[Remove from centralMtus, addressToIdentity]
    E2 --> F[Fire onCentralDisconnected callback]

    subgraph Defensive["Defensive Loop Exit (safety net)"]
        G[Keepalive attempt] --> H{notifyCentrals result}
        H -->|Success| I[Continue loop]
        H -->|"No connected centrals"| J[Log warning, break loop]
        H -->|Other error| K[Log warning, continue loop]
    end
```

- Cleanup: `BleGattServer.disconnectCentral()` line 477
- Defensive exit: `BleGattServer.startPeripheralKeepalive()` lines 1045-1048
- Stop function: `BleGattServer.stopPeripheralKeepalive()` lines 1067-1073

## Scanning and Advertising

### Adaptive Scanning

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Active["Active Mode"]
        A1[Interval: 5s]
        A2[BALANCED / LOW_LATENCY]
    end

    subgraph Idle["Idle Mode"]
        I1[Interval: 30s]
        I2[LOW_POWER]
    end

    Start([Start]) --> Active
    Active -->|3 empty scans| Idle
    Idle -->|New device found| Active
```

### Scan Configuration

| Parameter | Active | Idle |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Interval | 5 seconds | 30 seconds |
| Duration | 10 seconds | 10 seconds |
| Mode | `BALANCED` / `LOW_LATENCY` | `LOW_POWER` |
| Transition | 1 new device → stay Active | 3 empty scans → Idle |

**Key implementation details** (BleScanner.kt lines 60-66, 354-358):
- **LOW_LATENCY** mode activates when > 3 new devices discovered in one scan (high activity environment)
- **BALANCED** mode is the default for active scanning
- **LOW_POWER** mode after 3 consecutive scans find no new devices (stable environment)

### Advertising with Proactive Refresh

**Problem**: Android silently stops BLE advertising when the app goes to background, the screen turns off, or the device enters Doze mode. There's no callback when this happens—the app thinks it's still advertising but is actually invisible to scanners.

**Solution**: Proactively stop and restart advertising every 60 seconds. If advertising was still active, no harm done. If Android killed it, this brings it back.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Adv as BleAdvertiser
    participant Timer as Refresh Timer<br/>(60s interval)
    participant Android as Android BLE

    Adv->>Android: startAdvertising()
    alt Success
        Android-->>Adv: onStartSuccess()
        Adv->>Adv: retryAttempts = 0
        Adv->>Timer: Start refresh job
    else Failure
        Android-->>Adv: onStartFailure(errorCode)
        loop Up to 5 retries
            Note over Adv: Wait (2s × attempt)
            Adv->>Android: startAdvertising()
        end
    end

    loop Every 60 seconds
        Timer->>Adv: Check: isAdvertising && !isRefreshing?
        Adv->>Android: stopAdvertising()
        Note over Adv: 100ms delay
        Adv->>Android: startAdvertisingInternal()
        Note over Adv: Ensures advertising persists<br/>after screen off/background
    end
```

**Key implementation details** (BleAdvertiser.kt lines 48-120, 338-396):
- **Retry with backoff**: On failure, retries up to 5 times with delay = 2s × attempt number
- **Refresh guard**: Uses `isRefreshing` flag to prevent concurrent refresh operations
- **100ms cleanup delay**: Brief pause between stop/start ensures Android BLE stack resets properly
- **Internal restart**: Refresh calls `startAdvertisingInternal()` to bypass the "already advertising" check

### Advertisement Data Structure

```
Advertising Data (31 bytes max):
├── Flags (3 bytes)
└── Service UUID (19 bytes for 128-bit UUID)

Scan Response (31 bytes separate budget):
└── Device Name: "RNS-{6_hex_chars}"  (e.g., "RNS-ab12cd")
```

**Note**: Device name uses first 3 bytes of identity (6 hex chars) due to BLE payload limits. Full 16-byte identity is exchanged via GATT characteristic during connection handshake (Protocol v2.2).

## Potential Issues & Recommendations

### 1. GATT Operation Timeout (5s default)

**Issue**: The default 5-second timeout in `BleOperationQueue` may be too short for slow or congested BLE environments.

**Impact**: GATT operations may fail prematurely on:
- Older devices with slower BLE stacks
- Environments with high 2.4GHz interference
- During rapid connection/disconnection cycles

**Recommendation**: Consider adaptive timeouts based on operation type and historical success rates.

**Note on Queue Deadlock Prevention**: The queue processor waits on `operationCompletion.receive()` for async operations (those returning `Pending`). The timeout handler **must** signal `operationCompletion.trySend(Unit)` after resuming the continuation with `TimeoutException`. Without this signal, the queue processor stays blocked forever, causing all subsequent operations across ALL connections to fail. See `BleOperationQueue.kt` lines 206-209.

### 2. Fragmenter Key Complexity

**Issue**: Fragmenter keys use `_get_fragmenter_key(identity, address)` but the address parameter is unused.

**Current code**:
```python
def _get_fragmenter_key(self, peer_identity, address):
    # Address unused - key is identity-based for MAC rotation immunity
    return self._compute_identity_hash(peer_identity)
```

**Recommendation**: Remove unused `address` parameter to avoid confusion.

### 3. Grace Period Timing

**Issue**: The 2-second detach grace period (`_pending_detach_grace_period`) is hardcoded.

**Impact**: May not be sufficient for slow network conditions or concurrent reconnection attempts.

**Recommendation**: Make configurable via interface parameters, with a suggested default of 3-5 seconds.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Reactive Advertising Refresh

Currently, advertising refreshes on a 60-second timer. If Android kills advertising immediately after screen-off, the device could be undiscoverable for up to 60 seconds.

**Enhancement**: Add a `BroadcastReceiver` for `ACTION_SCREEN_OFF` to trigger an immediate advertising refresh, reducing worst-case invisibility from 60 seconds to ~100ms.
